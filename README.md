# Digit-recognition
This is a 5 layered sequeuntial convolutional neural network.
Used MNIST data set for training.
Achieved an accuracy of 99.14% on 30 epochs on MNIST data set.
Digit recognition.ipynb is the code that is used to construct the convolutional neural network.
The network thus created is also uploaded as digit recognition model.h5
The train and test models in the code were also uploaded as zip files.
cnn_mnist_datagen is the predicted answers for the testing data.
gui code allows you to manually draw any digit and let the code predict it.
